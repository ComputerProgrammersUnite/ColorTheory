## Creating the Project
-- Only The Method for Creating an Eclipse Project is Explained here --
To Create an Eclipse project navigate to the same folder that the gradlew.bat file is located. Open a command window here by `Shift + Right Click` in a blank space in the folder and click `Open Command Window Here` from here type the command `gradlew eclipse`. The eclipse project will now be created and it is now possible to import this git project into eclipse using the eclipse import option.

## Building the JAR file
Open a command window the same way as when creating a project but instead of using the command `gradlew eclipse` use the command `gradlew clean build` and the project will build into a jar file as long as there are no errors with your setup of the project.
